## 📖 About the Certification

This certification demonstrates proficiency in writing semantic HTML and responsive CSS. It involved learning and practicing concepts through interactive tutorials, followed by five hands-on web development projects.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- ✅ Semantic HTML structure  
- ✅ Responsive design with CSS Media Queries  
- ✅ Layout techniques with Flexbox and Grid  
- ✅ Styling forms, buttons, and UI components  
- ✅ Mobile-first design practices  
- ✅ Accessibility and usability principles  
- ✅ Navigation and linking strategies  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Learning Environment

The projects were built through [freeCodeCamp's interactive course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/), which provided:

- 🧭 Step-by-step guidance  
- 💡 Real-time feedback  
- 🧩 Contextual hints

This structure made it easier to grasp new concepts and apply them in project challenges.

Even though hints were available, I **independently built and structured every project**, which helped me grow as a beginner developer and understand real-world HTML/CSS usage.
